# Ravenous

This is a codecademy project completed by Zac Hooper

__Version__: 1.2

### To do
- ~~Make addresses clickable and have them open the address in Google Maps in a new tab~~
    - Style the links
- Make images clickable and have them open the business’ website in a new tab
- Clicking on a different sorting option automatically requeries the Yelp API, rather than having to manually click “Let’s Go” again
- Implement your own type of sort (for example, by entering a distance or radius from a central location)
- ~~Allow you to search by pressing “Enter” (or “Return”) on your keyboard, as opposed to manually clicking~~
- Add autocompletion of addresses to the “Location” input
